- commands structure
- `<driver/program> <command> [arguments] [options]`
- here driver is `dotnet`
- in context of dotnet there are two usages:
- `dotnet [runtime options] [path to app] [args]` ------> to run a project
- `dotnet [sdk options] [command] [command options] [args]` ---> to run a cmd

- you can look through all these options and commands by typing `dotnet --help` in cmd

- `dotnet new gitignore` --> crates a gitignore file that already has a lot in it
- `dotnet new --list` --> lists all what you can create
- `dotnet new sln` --> creates a solutions file (.sln) (with nothing in it) with the same name as of the folder it's in
- `dotnet new console` --> makes a console app, DEFAULT LANGUAGE FOR ALL THIS is C#.
- -o <location/> ----> location to put the output of the command
- `dotnet sln add <ProjLocation>` ---> add the project in the solution file of the directory
- `dotnet new classlib -o <a name for that library>` --> creates a standard class
- `dotnet add package <NuGet package name>` --> need to be in a project folder to run this, it adds the latest version of the given NuGet package.
  It adds it into the references of the project you're in. (in the .csproj file)
- In our console app, we can add reference to the class lib file, `dotnet add reference <addr of class lib>`
- `dotnet restore` --> downloads all the mentioned (in .csproj file) Nuget packages' source codes, in the obj/ folder
- `dotnet build` --> compiles the project and creates assemblies (like .dll or .exe) based on your code, inside the bin/ folder. This first internally calls the restore command first, to install all the packages.
